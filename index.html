                <h3>Introduction</h3>

                <p>The hobby of motorcycling consists largely of spending money so that you can do most of the same
                    things that you can do in a car but be much less safe about it. Don't misunderstand. It is
                    exhilarating and fun. It just seems a bit silly when evaluated objectively. The first thing you
                    should do, even before getting a motorcycle is to get a helmet and some leather gloves. Next
                    you should take a basic motorcycle rider class. This really is the safest way to get started. Once
                    you pass the class and have a motorcycle endorsement on your driver's license. Then you can look
                    into buying a motorcycle.</p>
